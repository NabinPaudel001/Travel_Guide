                    <span class="e">Kathmandu, the capital and largest city in Nepal, is like no other city in the
                        world. The
                        decaying buildings in the heart of the city are a stark contrast to the lively atmosphere that
                        permeates the streets.For several hundred years, Kathmandu was one of three rival royal cities,
                        along
                        with Bhaktapur and Patan.The highlight of Kathmandu has long been Durbar Square, the largest of
                        the palace squares in the three royal cities.</span>

                        just outside of Kathmandu. For Bhaktapur, the trade route was both an arterial link and major
                        source of wealth.n contrast to Patan and Kathmandu, the population of Bhaktapur is primarily
                        Hindu. The best place from which to begin a tour of the city is Durbar Square, where in addition
                        to the royal palace, several temples are also situated.</span>
